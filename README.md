Data Analysis:

1. As we go from south of the equator(below the equator) to the line of equator Maximun temperature increase up to latitude (30) .
2. AS we go from line of eqautor to north of equator(above the equator) Maximum temperature decreases.
3. Humidity is more above the equator than below the equator.
4. we can not conclude  cloudiness on the basis of scatter plot because there is no clear trend.
5. Around the equator wind rises higher into the atmosphere and migrates toward the poles.

Trends:
1. There is a correlation between latitude and temperature. In the data set analyzed in June, the highest temperatures are found between 20 and 40 degrees latitude, the same latitude range where Sahara, Guadalajara and Gobi deserts are located. The Northern Hemisphere has more data points, which is expected since the northern hemisphere also contains greater land-mass than the Southern hemisphere.

2. There appears to be no correlation between latitude and cloudiness.

3.only weak correlation between latitude and wind speed. There are higher wind speeds observed in the southern hemisphere.

4. The correlation between latitude and humidity is also not pronounced. The humidity is higher in the northern hemisphere, which is to be expected as it is Summer in the northern hemisphere.
